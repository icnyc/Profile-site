  <h1 id="about"><span>About</span></h1>
  <p>I’m Irene. I design intuition. I left Taiwan to come to America because I wanted to experience more of the world and more creative freedom. After painting for years, I went to school in New York for oil painting. I love creativity, after working in fashion production and financial service for a few years my practical nature had me searching for balance. I saw an ad for a UX design course and didn’t know what UX design was. Upon researching, I realized it is something I have been passionate about for a long time but didn’t have a word to describe it. I knew I had found the balance I was looking for in a creative pursuit. Ever since I got into UX design, I strive to reach this balance between creativity and practicality in my work, and it helps me to be intuitive about what makes good design. I would love to work with people who share this goal and have a passion for communicating their ideas about how to reach it.
    <br>
I believe creativity plus practicality equals good design. I seek to be original in my work while at the same time adapting to the changing world around me. My clear sense of what makes good design allows me to offer a smooth experience that is not only intuitive but fulfilling for the user. I am a fastidious, hard-worker who understands the value of collaboration, and I have a genuine passion for discussing ideas as part of a shared vision. If you have a vision, you’d like to share with me, then feel free to reach out!​​</p>
